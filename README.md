C# Windows Form - Basic Text Diary Application

Hello, and welcome to my text diary application using C# Windows Forms.

The program is a very simple one - it prompts the user to enter a text diary entry, with three text boxes - a "Title", a "Date" and an "Entry". These text entries are then used in a couple of ways - they are
used in order to format the ".txt" file that the program ultimately produces, providing a clean diary entry with a title and date of entry at the top, and then the main body of text below. However, the "Title" 
is also used in order to name the ".txt" file that the program produces. When the "Submit Entry" button is pressed, the .txt file is created.

The program currently saves the .txt files to the bin\Debug folder, which is something I hope to change in the near future - I'm fairly new to this whole "programming" thing :) - and I also hope to make diary
applications using other programming languages and environments in the future (Python, JavaScript/React etc.). Incorporation of more multimedia elements (audio, image and video entries) is also something I would 
like to do further down the line. I also should probably write a way of allowing the program to close once the submit button is pushed, lest someone be swamped with .txt files from pushing it more than once.
